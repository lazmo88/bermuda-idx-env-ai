    TODO / IDEAS coordinator.py:
    - when we get to establishing a fix, we can apply a path-loss factor to
      a calculated vector based on previously measured losses on that path.
      We could perhaps also fine-tune that with real-time measurements from
      fixed beacons to compensate for environmental factors.
    - An "obstruction map" or "radio map" could provide field strength estimates
      at given locations, and/or hint at attenuation by counting "wall crossings"
      for a given vector/path.
